# Air-Pollution
CMP7005 - Programming for Data Analysis

This project analyses and predicts PM2.5 air pollution in Beijing using an exploratory data analysis to create a developed model for use in a GUI.

Task 1: Data Handling
- Merged data from four representative stations (urban, rural, suburban, industrial)
- Exported combined dataset for reuse

Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Cleaned dataset by removing duplicates and handling missing values
- Created univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualisations
- Exported cleaned dataset

Task 3: Model Building
- Trained multiple regression models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting)
- Evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, and R2
- Performed grid search and 5-fold cross-validation
- Exported lightweight model for GUI use

Task 4: GUI Development
- Developed an interactive Streamlit application
- Pages include: Data Overview, EDA, and PM2.5 Prediction
- Designed for user input of pollutant and weather features

Task 5: Version Control
- Project development tracked via commits to this GitHub repository

The trained model '.pkl' file used in the GUI is excluded from the repository due to upload file size limits.
